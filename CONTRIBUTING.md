### Hack some code!
It’s time to hack some code and submit it. [There’s a GitHub’s comprehensive guide to contributing](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), but here are the basic steps:

#### Register to GitHub
GitHub is the world’s largest programming collaboration tool in the world, if you’re not registered yet, [register for an account](https://github.com/join), you’ll need it.

#### Fork and clone the repo
Fork the repository so you can make the changes, just click the fork button at the top right of the repository page. You’ll need a local copy of your fork of the repository, so head over to you fork and clone it.

#### Create a new branch, make changes and test
Create a new local branch in your local clone and make some changes using your favorite code editor or IDE. Remember to change or create the respective tests, they’ll need to pass for your changes to be accepted.

#### Commit, push and pull request
Now commit the changes you’ve made, push to you fork of the repository and create a pull request.
We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), so when your pull request is created all tests will be automatically run, if any of them don’t pass you’ll have to check what’s wrong, fix it, commit and push before you changes can be merged.

Feel free to comment on the pull request with questions to any of the repo admins.
